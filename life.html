        <p>
        I have been putting enormous effort on gaining diverse experiences in life. I found myself closely connected to different forms of art. Music, above all, is the one that has laid the most profound impact on me. Ten years of training on classical piano and four years on violin enable me to perceive melodic beauty and instill emotions into my musical performance. Obsessed with the idea of sharing the joy of music with people, I performed in various places, formally and informally, to one-time audiences and to people I care about. Taking the course <i>Mozart</i> further drove me to putting music into historical and cultural contexts and analyzed it thoroughly. In order to appreciate more the beauty of music, I will dig deeper into the understanding of the musicians I like and the relevant historical background.

        <br><br><br>

        <!--I love everything about the piano. I fully appreciate the 10-year training of classical piano starting from the kindergarten days and the assistance provided by my parents. I performed in various places, formally and informally, to one-time audiences and to people I care about. 
         
         <br><br>The true beauty of playing the piano reveals itself, I believe, when the player forgets everything about playing, the beats, the fingerings and dynamics, the meausres that he always gets it wrong. 
         Until then, all the player's doing is simply enjoying the music and control the pace and emotions unwittingly and effortlessly, almost like engaging it from a 3rd-person point of view. 
         
         <br><br>I am also a lover of classical music. As an elementary school, everytime I took a nap at home, the background music always began with the opening pound of <i>Chopin's Ballade No.1</i> and ended at his <i>Revolutionary Etude</i>, almost like a wake-up call. "Mozart" (Music5064) is definitely one of the best course I took in college. 16 weeks of lectures plus discussion sessions covered Mozart's life, the historical, cultural and religious background of some of his greatest compositions.

    <div id="life-title"><h3>Culinary Art</h3></div>

    <div class="col-12">
        <div class='life-content'>
          <p>
          Culinary art is another form of art that touches my soul. I am obsessed with the quest of combing taste, texture, aroma and presentation on a single dish, and intrigued by busy kitchen scenes where cooks, either for survival or self-fulfillment, rush around amidst the steamy aisles, sizzling foods and chef’s shouting orders. The motivation first drove me to joining the Cake&amp;Pastry Club at NTU for a whole year. (The club is formally known as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/NTUESC" target="_blank">NTUESC</a> &mdash; NTU Egg Studying Club, since the study and practice on egg cookery is fundamental in baking pastry) Later, a couple of months of informal apprenticeship at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Rebirth.cafe/?fref=ts" target="_blank">Rebirth</a>, a popular café&amp;restaurant, empowered me with practical cooking skills. Another month working as a line cook in a paste house enriched my human experiences and made me appreciate more the importance of having empathy. Afterwards, looking for opportunities to try on different dishes, I started cooking meals for friends. The process of planning recipes and cooking steps, gathering ingredients at food markets, and carrying out the actual cooking of several dishes in a rather short period of time all by myself was extremely exhausting but super exciting. As for the joy of sharing food I cook with friends? Unforgettable.

          <!--
          I Love the way food comunicates and how it connects everyone culturally and emotionally. 民以食為天。Food is always the best topic at any dining table. Food is memory, bringing back childhood whenever one takes a sip/bite of hometown cuisine. Food is cultural heritage, a concentration of countless stories, endeavors and discoveries of past generations. 

          <br><br>Learning how to cook. It had been kind of a struggle whether to devote time and enrgy into this field when I was already occupied with research and courseworks and everything. Frankly speaking, the breath-taking train views of Switzerland during the BioCAS 2014 trip is the last straw. 

          <br><br>The 2-month informal apprenticeship at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Rebirth.cafe/?fref=ts" target="_blank">Rebirth</a>, one of the most popular Cafe&amp;Restaurants around the campus, has truly broadened my horizon - about cooking, food cultures, the restaurant and the cafe industry, and probably most essential of all, the choices in life. Making friends with the restaurant owner and the part-time staffs, and listening to their stories - what the different walks of life pursue as their life-long goal - were inspiring.

          <br><br>Food is not solely about feeding, the same way as cooking is not just about making food. To cook is like to experiment, where recipes are just guidance. Cooking is also about responsibility. For people just start cooking, it is always fun. But when it becomes a routine, where one has to plan beforehand, do grocery shopping and finish cooking all in limited time, and also do food preservation, cooking is kind of a burden. I was lucky enough to learn the basics of cooking from the apprenticeship and allowed to work as a cook in the pasta house near our dorms for one month. Cooking a dish of Carbonara (pasta with egg, cheese, bacon and black pepper) is exciting, but cooking twenty same dishes under constant pressure is no fun at all. There were always dishes sent back because of mistakes made by servers, customers' requests of changing orders, and the orders misread by cooks. For me, the worst of all about working in a busy kitchen of an ordinary restaurant is the necessary compromise of food quality, since slow serving almost leads straight to losing customers forever. As a result, I learn almost nothing new about culinary art itself in this job. What I practiced and mastered is the skill to maintain up to three pasta pans at the same time, keeping every pan of pasta under control. 

          <br><br>Looking for opportunities to try on different dishes, I left the job and started cooking meals for friends. Preparing a perfect meal for yourself is memorable. Preparing a perfect meal for a couple of friends is remarkable. Preparing a meal for a big party, if successful, is phenomenal. Through these experiences, I found one of the driving force that fuels a great cook: sharing food. Watching all the smiles when people eat your food makes you proud, while their comments drive you to improve your cooking techniques.
