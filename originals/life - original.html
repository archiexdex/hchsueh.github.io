        <p>I love everything about the piano. 
         Piano is my savior, and playing it is my redemption.
         I fully appreciate the 10-year training of classical piano starting from the kindergarten days and the assistance provided by my parents.
         I performed in various places, formally and informally, to one-time audiences and to people I care about. 
         
         <br><br>The true beauty of playing the piano reveals itself, I believe, when I forget everything about playing, the beats, the fingerings and dynamics, the meausre that I always get it wrong. 
         Until then, all I am doing is just enjoying the music and control the pace and emotions unwittingly and effortlessly, almost like engaging it from 3rd-person point of view. All I think about is the memory that links to this music, or perhaps the composer's story behind it. 
         I've only achieved that state twice, on <i>Chopin's Nocturne in E-flat Major, Op.9 No.2</i>, and on <i>Debussy's Clair de lune</i>. ONE MORE REMARK
         
         <br><br>I am also a lover of classical music. As an elementary school, everytime I took a nap at home, the background music always began with the opening pound of <i>Chopin's Ballade No.1</i> and ended at his <i>Revolutionary Etude</i>, almost like a wake-up call.

        <br><br>"Mozart" (Music5064) is definitely one of the best course I took in college. 16 weeks of lectures plus discussion sessions covered Mozart's life, the historical, cultural and religious background of some of his greatest compositions.

          <p>
          Learning to cook. It had been kind of a struggle whether to devote time and enrgy into this field when I was already occupied with research and courseworks and everything. Frankly speaking, the breath-taking train views of Switzerland during the BioCAS 2014 trip is the last straw. The green pastures..

          <br><br>The 2-month informal apprenticeship at one of the most popular Cafe&amp;Restaurant around the campus broadened my horizon - about cooking, food cultures, the restaurant and the cafe industry, and probably most essential of all, the choices in life. 

          <br><br>I Love the way food comunicates and how it connects everyone culturally and emotionally. 民以食為天。Food is always the best topic at any dining table. Food is memory, bringing back childhood whenever one takes a sip/bite of hometown cuisine. Food is cultural heritage, a concentration of countless stories, endeavors and discoveries of past generations. 

          <br><br>Food is not solely about eeding, the same way as cooking is not just about making food. Cooking is like experiment, where recipes are just guidance. Cooking is also about responsibility. For people just start cooking, it is always fun. But when it becomes a routine, where one has to plan beforehand, do grocery shopping and finish cooking all in limited time, and also do food preservation, cooking is kind of a burden. I was lucky enough to learn the basics of cooking from the apprenticeship and allowed to work as a cook in the pasta house near our dorms for one month. Cooking a dish of Carbonara (pasta with egg, cheese, bacon and black pepper) is exciting, but cooking twenty same dishes under constant pressure is no fun at all. There were always dishes sent back because servers made mistakes, customers' requests of changing orders, and cooks' misreading the orders. For me, the worst of all about working in a busy kitchen of an ordinary restaurant is the necessary compromise of food quality, since slow serving almost leads straight to losing customers forever. As a result, I learn almost nothing new about culinary art itself in this job. What I practiced and mastered is the skill to maintain up to three pasta pans at the same time, keeping every pan of pasta under control. 

          Preparing a perfect meal for yourself at that particular mood is memorable. Preparing a perfect meal for a couple of friends is remarkable. Preparing a meal for a big party is phenomenal.
