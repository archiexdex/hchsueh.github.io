      <p>
	  Getting my hands dirty to build things always excites me. As a child, I played with Lego Mindstorm and built countless robots in many different forms. As a teenager, I delved deeper into modeling physical phenomena through mathematics and experiments, which brought me to the stage of Asian Physics Olympiad 2010 as one of the eight representatives of Taiwan. As a college student, GPA was never the most important pursuit. I was instead driven by a personal mission of building up technical skills and practical experiences for tackling real-world problems. With an engineering mind and an invincible soul, I endeavored to pursue my passion and break through barriers despite obstacles throughout my college years.

<br><br>Albeit the popularity of learning high-level programming languages among my peers in the freshman year, I was more fascinated by how integrated circuits and systems bridge the physical and the digital worlds. I started by purchasing an Altera DE2-70 FPGA board as the learning platform. The training courses of VLSI and FPGA design taken at National Circuit Implementation Center (CIC), a national research and service center for IC design, laid the important foundation. Through countless hours of Verilog coding practices including flash memory controller, image display controller, local median filter, 2D Discrete Cosine Transform Engine, 6811-like microcontroller and Gauss-Seidel iteration machine, I became the youngest student ever taking and scoring A+ on the graduate course Computer-aided VLSI System Design and the youngest independent winner of graduate-level National Cell-Based Integrated Circuit Design Contest in my sophomore year.

<br><br>Throughout the years of building up IC design skills, I have been faced with the scarcity and exclusivity of relevant resources, yet I never gave up. I devoted lots of energy into repeated practices and reached for help in various forms. To refine my Verilog coding style towards better synthesis result, I consulted over and over the Verilog geeks in graduate research labs. To acquire synthesis techniques for area reduction and slack optimization, I ended up becoming a frequent asker on CIC hotline. And I crawled through professional forums for any bit of hint about power-planning and routing techniques that could lead to less congestion and zero DRC error. Combining this skillset with my passion for dealing with practical problems, I devoted my undergraduate research to develop low-power data-driven processors for continuous processing of physiological signals, starting from junior college year. With the research work later published in BioCAS and EDSSC conferences, I affirmed my aspiration to focus my graduate study on designing cutting-edge integrated circuits and systems for next-generation biomedical applications.

<br><br>I have always been self-motivated at doing things. Despite all difficulties, I clawed my way up to becoming a capable VLSI circuit designer and a productive researcher. Aside from pursuing my technical profession, I also seek other ways to elevate myself. Joining and lecturing in the English Debate Society in NTU has strengthened my ability to analyze complex issues and conveyed logically my viewpoints. Taking multiple classes on humanities has enlightened my heart, driving me to view things around me with a broader mind and greater curiosity. With my engineering background, versatile experiences and passion in humanities, I truly believe in my potential in pursuing my doctoral degree at a top graduate school where I will work with bright and ambitious colleagues to go after technical challenges and pursue ground-breaking innovations. 

<br><br>Spreading smart devices ubiquitously to improve quality of life will be my career goal. Silicon Valley, with abundant capital and a track record of disruptive innovation, will be my future battlefield. Aging population and growing wealth gap are the problems that we should dutifully devote ourselves in tackling. I will approach these problems in a technical orientation, harnessing the brainpower of the Valley to democratize the majority’s access to the medical services. As for the long-term goal, after gathering sufficient momentum and like-minded people, I will return to my homeland and help reform our technology industry as well as educational system.
